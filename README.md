About This Project:

I analyzed an HR employee dataset to understand employee attrition patterns and workforce trends.
Using Microsoft Excel, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with pivot tables, charts, and slicers to identify key factors influencing attrition such as department, job role, age group, gender, marital status, and education field.
The goal of this project was to help HR teams make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.

What I Used:

Microsoft Excel

Pivot Tables

Charts & KPI Cards

Slicers for interactivity

Data Cleaning & Data Preparation

What I Found:

Certain departments and job roles showed higher attrition compared to others

Employees in the 26–35 age group had the highest attrition rate

Single employees showed higher attrition than married employees

Attrition varied across education fields and gender, indicating workforce imbalance

The interactive dashboard helped identify high-risk employee segments easily
